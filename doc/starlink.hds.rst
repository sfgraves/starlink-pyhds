hds Package
===========

This package provides low-level access to HDS files.

Only use these functions if you are familiar with
the standard HDS library. You may need a little bit of knowledge of HDS to be
fully confident with aspects of this module.

There are many functional equivalents to HDS routines such as
dat_annul, dat_cell and dat_find.
Look at end of documentation to see the list and refer to the HDS
documentation for their use.
