ndf Package
===========

This package provides low-level access to NDF components.

Only use these functions if you are familiar with
the standard NDF library. You may need a little bit of knowledge of NDF to be
fully confident with aspects of this module.

There are many functional equivalents to NDF routines such as
ndf_acget, ndf_aread and ndf_begin.
Look at end of documentation to see the list and refer to the NDF
documentation for their use.
